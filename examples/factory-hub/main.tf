# A hub-and-spoke factory: a large square floor (room for a lot more
# machines than are wired up below) with a merger/splitter pair at the
# center acting as a single "central input" / "central output" - every
# producer belts into the merger, every consumer belts out of the splitter.
#
# Connector indices for the merger/splitter were determined empirically
# (spawn one, probe connectors 0-3 via POST /connections, read back the
# resulting belt's transform to see which side of the building each index
# sits on - see mod/README.md's "Connections" section for the general
# technique). Confirmed live against a running game session:
#
#   Build_ConveyorAttachmentMerger_C     Build_ConveyorAttachmentSplitter_C
#     0 = input  (back,  -x)               0 = output (front, +x)
#     1 = output (front, +x)               1 = input  (back,  -x)
#     2 = input  (side,  +y)               2 = output (side,  +y)
#     3 = input  (side,  -y)               3 = output (side,  -y)
#
# A merger only has 3 inputs and a splitter only has 3 outputs - that's a
# real in-game constraint (one belt per connector), which is why this
# topology tops out at 3 producers / 3 consumers per hub even though the
# floor has room for many more machines. Scale by adding more hubs, not
# more spokes per hub.
#
# Local dev against the mock: see the mock-stack skill
# (.claude/skills/mock-stack/SKILL.md) - same loop as examples/iron-plate-line.
